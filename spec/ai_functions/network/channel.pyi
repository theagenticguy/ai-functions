"""WireChannel — symmetric RPC machinery shared by client and endpoint.

A :class:`WireChannel` wraps a :class:`Transport` and provides:

- ``call(method, **params)`` — initiate an outbound RPC; await the result.
- ``send_event(event)`` — broadcast a server-initiated event (no response).
- ``register(method_name, handler)`` — install an inbound dispatch handler.
- ``on_event(callback)`` — subscribe to inbound event frames.

Both sides of the wire use the same ``WireChannel`` class. The asymmetry
between "client" and "endpoint" is entirely in which handlers each side
registers (``coordinator.*`` on the endpoint; ``worker.*`` on a client
that hosts a worker) — the channel itself is symmetric.
