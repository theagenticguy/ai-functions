"""CoordinatorClient — ``Coordinator`` implementation over a WireChannel.

Connects to a :class:`CoordinatorEndpoint` over a single WebSocket and
proxies every :class:`~ai_functions.protocols.Coordinator` method as an outbound
RPC call. Also accepts *inbound* RPC calls from the endpoint when the
client hosts a worker (the endpoint must reach the worker's adapter
methods over the same connection).

Usage::

    client = await CoordinatorClient.connect("ws://localhost:9900/rpc")
    worker = LocalWorker(client)
    await worker.register()
    handle = await worker.spawn_locally(my_fn)

The client registers its hosted workers with the endpoint on first use;
thereafter, inbound ``worker.*`` calls from the endpoint are dispatched
to the matching ``LocalWorker`` instance via the shared ``WireChannel``.
