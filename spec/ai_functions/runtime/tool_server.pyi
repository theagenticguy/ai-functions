"""``CoordinatorToolServer`` — the runtime tools over streamable-HTTP MCP.

Serves the two coordinator tools from
:mod:`ai_functions.runtime.coordinator_tools_core` (``list_threads`` /
``send_message``) over HTTP, so agent runtimes that take an ``mcp_servers`` URL
— Codex among them — can join a team without per-runtime bridge code. Runs in
the process owning the coordinator.

Clients must send the token in the ``Authorization: Bearer`` header.

One server hosts any number of threads; each registration mints its own
capability URL of the form ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp/<routing-id>``.

The server binds 127.0.0.1 on a system-assigned port; pass the registration URL
to the runtime as it starts. The port is reachable by any local process, so the
*token* is the boundary: each registration mints a ``secrets``-grade token
required in the ``Authorization: Bearer`` header (constant-time compared), the
``Host`` header must name the bound address (DNS-rebinding defense per the MCP
spec's guidance for local HTTP servers), and deregistration revokes the token
immediately.

The MCP app runs stateless (``stateless_http=True``) and answers in JSON
(``json_response=True``): tools and one-shot reads only — no server-initiated
messages, no resource subscriptions, so nothing needs an SSE stream.

Runs on either major of the ``mcp`` SDK (1.x ``FastMCP`` or 2.x ``MCPServer``).

Requires the ``runtime-tools`` extra (``mcp``, ``uvicorn``).
