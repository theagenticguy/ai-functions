"""Event hierarchy emitted through ``Coordinator.append_event``.

``Event`` is a discriminated-union hierarchy rooted at ``BaseEvent``. Each
concrete subclass carries a distinct ``kind`` string and only the payload
fields that apply to that kind.

System events have ``kind`` values drawn from ``EventKind`` (a ``StrEnum``).
User-defined events use any other string: subclass ``CustomEvent``, set
``kind`` to a stable application-level identifier, and add whatever fields
you need. Pydantic routes unknown ``kind`` values to ``CustomEvent`` via a
custom discriminator function, so the full ``Event`` union round-trips
across the wire without losing user-defined subclasses.

Filtering is uniform for both system and custom events — pass any ``kind``
string (``EventKind`` member or plain string) to ``Coordinator.on(kinds=...)``
or ``Coordinator.get_events(kinds=...)``.

    custom event that arrived over a ``CoordinatorClient``, ``get_events``

    it from a client that stamped the id itself.

    flattens on the way out, emitting the declared fields next to the

    A top-level key that names a declared field binds to that field, so

``union_mode="left_to_right"`` is what keeps a built-in kind out of
