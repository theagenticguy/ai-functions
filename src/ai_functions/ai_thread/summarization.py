    """Summarize a prefix via a model call, preserve a bounded tail.

    The built-in strategy. It chooses a tail of recent messages to keep verbatim (
    bounded below by ``preserve_min_messages`` / ``preserve_min_tokens`` and above by
    ``preserve_max_tokens``), advances the split to a legal tool-pair boundary (I10),
    and replaces everything before the split with a single synthetic user turn
    carrying a narrative summary produced by a helper thread.

    The helper-thread path is governed by ``summarize_by_forking``:

    - ``True`` — the helper inherits the parent's resolved cycle config (same model,
      system prompt, tools; tool execution denied via an internal hook).
      Requires ``cycle_config.structured_output is False``.
    - ``False`` — the helper uses a minimal dedicated config: parent's
      model only, no tools, a hard-coded summarization system prompt.
    - ``None`` — resolves to ``True`` iff ``cycle_config.structured_output is False``,
      else ``False``. Resolved per call, so one instance is reusable across threads with
      different output shapes.

    Args:
        summarize_by_forking: Fork policy (see above). ``None`` resolves lazily per call
            based on ``cycle_config``.

        preserve_min_tokens: Floor on the number of tokens (estimated) kept verbatim.

            Messages that push the tail past this bound are summarized instead.
