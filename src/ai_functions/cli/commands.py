"""Non-TUI ``ai_functions`` subcommands — ``ps``, ``logs``, ``notify``, ``submit``, ``kill``, ``run``.

Each function is a Typer command body, callable directly from tests
via ``typer.testing.CliRunner`` on the top-level
:data:`ai_functions.cli.app` app. Every command follows the same skeleton:

1. Resolve the coordinator URL (``--url`` > env var > runtime file).
2. Open a short-lived :class:`CoordinatorClient`.
3. Issue the relevant RPC(s).
4. Close the client; print one line per record or emit a formatted
   :class:`RenderableType` for each event.

``run_cmd`` is the odd one out: it loads a user script, locates the
main :class:`Spawnable`, and hands it to :func:`ai_functions.serve`. It does
not open its own client — :func:`ai_functions.serve` does.

    resolves. By default the typed result is printed to stdout (strings
    verbatim, other types via ``repr``).

    summed ``token_usage`` across the cycle's ``TokenUsageEvent`` events,

    it is already persisted by the time ``submit`` resolves), and the

    before submitting.

    Only ``STR_PROMPT`` threads accept a single freeform string from the

    refuses to guess at the arguments and exits with a clear error —
    those threads must be driven from a client script via
