"""Token-usage aggregation over the event log.

Usage accounting is derived, not stored: the coordinator's event log is the
single source of truth (I2), and this module folds ``TOKEN_USAGE`` events into
:class:`~ai_functions.types.TokenUsage` totals on demand. Working over the
:class:`~ai_functions.protocols.Coordinator` protocol (``get_events`` only)
keeps it usable against any implementation, including a remote
``CoordinatorClient``.

Warm-seeded threads (``spawn(seed_from=...)``) start with a *copy* of the
source thread's log, including its ``TOKEN_USAGE`` and ``THREAD_SPAWNED``
events. Counting those would attribute the source's spend to the new thread,
so callers measuring a seeded thread pass ``since_id`` — typically
:func:`last_event_id` captured right after spawn — to fold only events
appended after that point.
