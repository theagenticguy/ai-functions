"""Worker: process-local execution engine.

A worker owns one asyncio dispatcher task per thread it hosts, plus the
queues, signals, and live ``Thread`` instances needed to drive them. It
registers itself with a :class:`Coordinator` and serves operations that
the coordinator routes to it via the :class:`WorkerAdapter` protocol.

A concrete :class:`LocalWorker` is provided. Users who want a different
execution strategy (multi-process, thread-pool-backed, etc.) can write
their own concrete class that implements ``WorkerAdapter``; there is no
``Worker`` protocol beyond the adapter.

Invariants:
    - I1 — the worker is the sole host for every thread it registers.
    - I4 — the dispatcher task for a thread is created only after all
      per-thread state (and any seeded history) is fully populated.
    - I5 — the dispatcher is the sole emitter of lifecycle events
      (``STARTED``, ``COMPLETED``, ``CANCELLED``, ``FAILED``, ``RESULT``).
    - I12 — if a dispatcher task dies with an uncaught exception,
      every pending ``PromptRequest`` future on that thread MUST be
      failed with that exception. No caller of ``handle.run(...)`` is
      allowed to hang because the dispatcher crashed.
